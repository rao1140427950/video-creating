# video-creating
Combine several images and create a video.</br>
For example, I took photos of stars for about one and a half hours and I get about 100 images of the stars. Then I combine these images to create a video of stars moving in the sky.</br>
The source images are too big to upload. So I just upload the source code and an example output. Please see moving_stars.avi.
